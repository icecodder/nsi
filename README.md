# nsi
Welcome to the repository of all my NSI projects.

## What is NSI?

In France, it is a speciality of Première and Terminale (11th & 12th Grade in US). NSI is an acronym of **N**umérique et **S**ciences **I**nformatiques, it could be translated into "Digital and Computer Sciences". In fact it is a course where we teach computer science in a very general way.

## Why this repo?

In NSI, we do many projects alone or with several people. So I decided to share all this on Github freely under license.

## Disclaimer

All that is present here are generally small scripts that are not very interest and often have no correspondence between them.
